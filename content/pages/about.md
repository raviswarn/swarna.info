Hi! My name is Michael Toth, and I'm a data scientist living in New York City.

I try to keep my blog updated with posts about data analysis, data visualization, and programming projects I'm working on. Some of these are interesting side projects I'm exploring and some of them are solutions to challenging real-world problems that I've tackled at work. I hope they'll be helpful and interesting to you!

I'm currently working at [Orchard](https://www.orchardplatform.com) as a data scientist, where I head up the research team. Orchard is the leading provider of data, technology, and software to the online lending industry. Founded in New York City in 2013, Orchard is building the infrastructure to power the many interactions between originators and institutional investors and help grow online lending into an efficient, transparent, and global financial market. I spend a lot of my time producing reproducible research reports on the industry, creating new and exciting data visualizations, expanding the feature set of our product, and serving as an analytical & financial expert in sales & client conversations. For a sample of some of the public work I've done at Orchard, be sure to check out the links on my [writing page]({filename}./writing.md)

I do the majority of my day-to-day work and analyses using R and *nix command-line tools, but I also have experience with the Python data science stack. I enjoy experimenting with different tools, and recently I've spent some time working with D3.js and Tableau, which I hope to do more of in the future.  

Prior to Orchard I was working as a portfolio analyst at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com) where I worked with large institutional investment clients to value and assess the risks of their investment portfolios.

I graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where I concentrated in statistics and finance and received a minor in mathematics.

Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out in coffee shops, drinking craft beer, and playing squash and table tennis. I also produce art using R, which you can check out on [My Etsy Store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ArtfulData)!

If you find any of my posts or projects interesting, definitely reach out! I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!

I publish all of my R posts on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) where you'll also find a ton of amazing R content from other users.
